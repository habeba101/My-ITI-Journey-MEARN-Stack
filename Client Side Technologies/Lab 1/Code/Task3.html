<font color="green">My dog is Sacha is my best friend. She likes to choose the soccer ball when I practice. It is funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth. it just won't fit</font>


<p><font color="green">Once Sasha saved my life. when I was only 4 years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled accross the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mad until I saw car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</font></p>
